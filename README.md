# BLING BLING ON-CHAIN GAMING
Online game on Blockchain platform

## Brief Description
Bling bling is an online game based on the blockchain platform. With a simple interface that is easy to use but equally eye-catching. The game allows you to start the game by minting a character based on the core NFT TBA (Token-bound Account) to serve login and authentication for deeper features such as playing games, minting items, see rankings. Using ERC-6551 makes item management convenient, easy and transparent between players. After building a desired character, players can trade TBA NFTs on the app's marketplace in exchange for Bling coins (an asset - ERC20 is used on this app)
